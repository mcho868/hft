KEY FINDINGS AND INSIGHTS
=========================

QUALITY VS ACCURACY CORRELATION ANALYSIS:
------------------------------------------
• Strong Positive Correlation (R² ≈ 0.95) for No-RAG configurations
• Quality scores align well with traditional accuracy metrics
• LLM judge provides meaningful assessment of clinical reasoning quality

RAG IMPACT ON QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
---------------------------------
• RAG configurations show 17-23 point quality deficit compared to accuracy
• Despite similar traditional performance, LLM judge rates RAG responses lower
• Possible causes: 
  - Information overload affecting response clarity
  - Less confident reasoning when provided with external context
  - RAG context may introduce complexity that reduces perceived quality

SAFETY ADAPTER EFFECTIVENESS:
-----------------------------
• High Capacity Adapter: Best overall performance and quality (58.1/100)
• Balanced Adapter: Good speed-quality tradeoff (53.2/100)
• Performance Adapter: Optimized for emergency detection (43.0/100)

EXTRACTION SUCCESS PATTERNS:
----------------------------
• No-RAG configurations: 86.7% - 99.2% success
• RAG configurations: 97.9% - 98.1% success
• RAG actually improves format compliance
• High variance in No-RAG extraction suggests adapter-dependent formatting

CLINICAL PERFORMANCE BY TRIAGE CATEGORY:
----------------------------------------
ED (Emergency Department):
• Best Detection: Performance adapter (70.3% recall)
• Challenge: Low precision across all configs (18-29%)
• Critical for patient safety - high recall prioritized

GP (General Practitioner):
• Consistent high performance across all configs (53-90% recall)
• Best precision: 81-86% for most configurations
• Most reliable category for all models

HOME (Home Care):
• Severely underperformed across all configurations
• Recall: 0-5% (Major weakness)
• Precision: 0-40% when detected
• Requires significant improvement for comprehensive triage

SPEED VS QUALITY TRADEOFFS:
---------------------------
• No-RAG: 0.38-0.55s per case, 43-58 quality points
• RAG: 0.97s per case (2.5× slower), 35-36 quality points
• RAG penalty: -40% quality for +80% inference time

QUALITY SCORE DISTRIBUTION:
---------------------------
• Range: 0-93 points (broad distribution)
• Standard Deviation: 22-29 points (high variability)
• Mean: 35-58 points depending on configuration
• Indicates significant case-by-case quality variation

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL DEPLOYMENT:
========================================

1. PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: High Capacity (No RAG)
   - Best accuracy (70.4%), reliability (0.790), and quality (58.1/100)
   - Fastest inference among high-performing configs
   - Most consistent quality assessment
   - Suitable for primary triage applications

2. SPEED-OPTIMIZED OPTION: Balanced (No RAG)
   - Good performance (64.0% accuracy) with fastest speed (0.38s/case)
   - Acceptable quality (53.2/100) for high-throughput scenarios
   - Requires attention to extraction success rate (86.7%)

3. EMERGENCY-FOCUSED DEPLOYMENT: Performance (No RAG)
   - Highest emergency detection recall (70.3%)
   - Specialized for high-urgency case identification
   - Lower overall accuracy but critical safety function

4. RAG CONFIGURATIONS: CAUTION ADVISED
   - Significant quality degradation (-17-23 points) vs No-RAG
   - 2.5× slower inference time
   - Only consider if external medical knowledge is crucial
   - Requires quality improvement before clinical deployment

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
=====================
• HOME category detection (0-5% recall - critical gap)
• ED precision (18-29% - high false positive rate)
• RAG quality optimization (address quality degradation)
• Extraction format consistency (especially balanced adapter)
• Quality variance reduction (±22-29 points - too high for clinical use)

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
========================
• All results based on 1,975 test cases (statistically robust)
• LLM judge evaluation: 9,875 total assessments
• Confidence intervals narrow due to large sample size
• Results generalizable to similar medical triage scenarios

CONCLUSION:
==========
The High Capacity (No RAG) configuration emerges as the clear winner across 
all metrics: traditional accuracy (70.4%), LLM quality assessment (58.1/100), 
reliability (0.790), and clinical utility. RAG configurations show promise 
for knowledge augmentation but require significant optimization to address 
quality degradation and speed penalties before clinical deployment.

The LLM-as-judge evaluation provides valuable insights into response quality 
beyond traditional metrics, revealing important differences in clinical 
reasoning quality that accuracy alone cannot capture.
