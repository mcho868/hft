    "next_step": "Book a non-urgent GP appointment to discuss management options, such as medicines to manage symptoms, physical therapy, and potentially Botox injections or other treatments.",
    "reasoning": "The triage decision to refer the patient to a GP is appropriate because the patient's symptoms, such as shaking hands and arms, and difficulty walking, suggest a potential neurological condition like Parkinson's disease, which requires a thorough evaluation and management by a primary care physician.
