KEY INSIGHTS FROM UNKNOWN TRACKING:
----------------------------------------
1. Extraction Success Rate provides crucial insight into model reliability
2. UNKNOWN cases reveal parsing/format issues vs true performance gaps
3. Reliability Score (accuracy + extraction) gives holistic view
4. RAG impact should be measured on both accuracy AND extraction success
5. Model comparison is now honest (no artificial GP inflation)
